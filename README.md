# BridgeFi

BridgeFi is a comprehensive decentralized finance platform that combines cross-chain swaps, on-chain credit scoring, and decentralized lending into a single, user-friendly ecosystem. Built on the Stacks blockchain with Clarity smart contracts, BridgeFi empowers users to seamlessly exchange assets, build credit history, and access fair lending opportunities.

## What is BridgeFi?

BridgeFi revolutionizes DeFi by integrating three powerful features:

### ðŸ”„ Cross-Chain Swaps
Exchange STX tokens for EVM-compatible assets (like USDC) instantly and securely through audited smart contracts with low fees (0.5%).

### ðŸ“Š On-Chain Credit Scores
Build your decentralized credit score (300-850 range) based on transaction history, successful swaps, account activity, and loan repayment behavior.

### ðŸ’° Decentralized Lending
Borrow STX tokens secured by collateral with fair 10% annual interest rates. Loan limits vary by credit score:
- **Low Score (300-499)**: Up to 10 STX
- **Medium Score (500-699)**: Up to 25 STX
- **High Score (700-850)**: Up to 50 STX

## Key Features

- **Fast & Secure**: Transactions complete in 10-60 seconds with audited contracts
- **Credit-Based Access**: Higher scores unlock better loan terms and limits
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Seamlessly bridge between Stacks and EVM networks
- **Transparent Fees**: Clear pricing with no hidden costs
- **Non-Custodial**: Users maintain full control of their assets

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Elysia.js with Bun runtime
- **Blockchain**: Stacks with Clarity smart contracts
- **Database**: MongoDB
